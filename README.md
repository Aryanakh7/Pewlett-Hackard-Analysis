# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Purpose of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This will help the company elaborate a strategy to manage the retirement of current and future employees and develop a plan of action for future employees, while preparing strategies for the implementation of a mentorship program by identifying who is eligible to participate.

## Analysis Results 

From the analysis performed on the Pewlett Hackard data regarding the number of retiring employees, the following can be deduced:

- There are **90,398** retiring employees.
- As shown on the table below, Senior Engineers and Senior Staff will constitute more than half the number of retiring employees, as they respectively account for **29,414** and **28,254** of retiring employees.

- There are **1,549** employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program.
- There are only **two** Managers who will retire. 

## Conclusion

There is a total of 300,024 employees working at Pewlett Hackard and 90,398 of them are retiring.
Expressed as a percentage, almost 30% of all employees are retiring.
As illustrated below, the Development Department and the Production Department have the highest number of employees per department and will therefore be affected by the increasing number of employees who are retiring.

### Employee Mentorship Program

Since 90,398 employees are leaving the company for retirement, the same number of positions will have to be filled. The retiring employees eligible to participate in the program will not be enough to mentor the next generation of employees as for every available eligible mentor, there are 58 mentees.

This could be resolved by extending the eligibility of the program to include Senior staff and Managers who were not born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965. 
By expanding the eligibility criteria of mentors, there will be more mentors available and a more adequate ratio of employees assigned as mentees. This will prevent the quality of the mentorship from deteriorating and will help achieve the intended goals of the mentorship program.
